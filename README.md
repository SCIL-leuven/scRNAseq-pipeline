# scRNAseq-pipeline
Pipeline using snakemake to generate BAM files from FASTQ files. Alignment is performed with STAR reference genome mouse/human ... . HTSeqCount performs read counting step, NGSplot generates heatmaps and gene coverage plots and log files will be analyzed by MultiQC.

Snakemake to generate automated workflows.
